Accounts:
 Ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions on Ethereum. Accounts can be user-controlled or deployed as smart contracts.

ACCOUNT TYPES:
1. Externally-owned – controlled by anyone with the private keys
2. Contract – a smart contract deployed to the network, controlled by code.

ACCOUNT vs WALLET
An account is not a wallet. An account is the keypair for a user-owned Ethereum account. 
A wallet is an interface or application that lets you interact with your Ethereum account.
