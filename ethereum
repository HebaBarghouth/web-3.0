Accounts:
 Ethereum account is an entity with an ether (ETH) balance that can send transactions on Ethereum. Accounts can be user-controlled or deployed as smart contracts.

ACCOUNT TYPES:
1. Externally-owned – controlled by anyone with the private keys
2. Contract – a smart contract deployed to the network, controlled by code.

ACCOUNT vs WALLET
An account is not a wallet. An account is the keypair for a user-owned Ethereum account. 
A wallet is an interface or application that lets you interact with your Ethereum account.

TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS
On Ethereum there are a few different types of transactions:

Regular transactions: a transaction from one wallet to another.
Contract deployment transactions: a transaction without a 'to' address, where the data field is used for the contract code.

BLOCKS:
Blocks are batches of transactions with a hash of the previous block in the chain. 
This links blocks together (in a chain) because hashes are cryptographically derived from the block data. 
This prevents fraud, because one change in any block in history would invalidate all the following blocks as all subsequent hashes 
would change and everyone running the blockchain would notice.
